# The Monkees Band 
_Full Stack Software Developer - Century College_

This is a static (front-end only) website for the Monkees Band. 

The band is a [the 1960s] rock band and has been around for 50 years with experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. 
I have been given the following requirements after interviews with the clientâ€™s representatives:
- The Monkees primary target audiences are their fans 
- Fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog or any new material as it becomes available can do so.
- the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicize their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

> In my website, I have YouTube videos, articles, and posters for the Monkees band. On the Fan page, I have a form where the user can order videos. On the news page, I have all the current news for the Monkees. I have videos for Christmas and weddings and the latest news for their next events for the wedding or Christmas.
> From my website, the user will be inspired to buy more videos and, at the same time, they will get all the latest news.
